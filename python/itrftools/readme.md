itrftools is a collection of Python modules to assist the processing and
manipulation of ITRF-related files ease computation and extrapolation of
station coordinates.

The package requires numpy (http://www.numpy.org/) and should work both for
Python 2.x and Python 3.x. No other requirement exists.

The package is acompanied by a (Python) script under /bin/itrftool, which gets
automatically installed (during the ppackage installation process) and can
perform:
    * Coordinate extrapolation to a reference epoch using a SSC file, optionaly
      including a PSD file (for ITRF2014)
    * PSD computation (per component)
Stations to be considered can be identified either by their 4-char ID or via
their DOMES. See the script's help message for more info.

To install the package and the executable, run
$> python setup.py install

To make use of the package and/or script, you will need the relevant files
(e.g. PSD and SSC files). All of these are publicly available at the ITRF
website (http://itrf.ensg.ign.fr/) and are **NOT** included within the package.

TODO:
Compute standard deviation values for the extrapolated station coordinates.
